%% Part 1-b - First Level (Categorical) Design Matrix with contrast manager 
%% [after 1-a(parametric), which is used for second level GLM and ROI identification]
%% This (1-b) is for DCM conditions specification

% See 'DCM_first_GLM.m'. 
% It is NOT the exact categorical version correspondence of the parametric of GLM with all covariates,
% because it ignore the notation(i.e., FF/FL/LL) and only split conditions
% by distance.
